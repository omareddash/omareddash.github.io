## Embedded Learning Systems

Class abstract: Embedded Systems are essential for state of the art fields like -but not limited to- smart cars, robotics, space applications, smart homes, biomedical devices, supply chain and many industries. Intelligent systems are becoming crucial and a key tool to use relying on deep learning methods. This course aims at combining both worlds together to offer edge and end user reliable and real-time solutions. The class will focus on system design rather than a bottom up approach for introductory embedded system classes.
Intelligence in systems nowadays typically relies on cloud servers for providing deep learning solutions. However, with security and privacy concerns as well as real time requirements for many applications that would require localizing the process of learning towards end user device or at the edge. State-of-the-art algorithms for applications like face recognition, object identification, and tracking utilize deep learning-based models for learning and inference. Edge-based systems like security cameras and self-driving cars makes use of deep learning to enhance performance of cognitive abilities. However, the main deciding factors for such edge-based systems are power, performance, and cost. These devices possess limited bandwidth, have zero latency tolerance, very constrained and require intense privacy issues most of the time. The technological conflict is further complicated by the fact that deep learning algorithms require computation of the order of tera-operations to train and finally get to the final inference model. Such high computational processing is not practical for edge devices. Yet deep learning is necessary to bring intelligence and autonomy to the edge and this class will focus on solutions and methods to bring it to the embedded level domain. 
This course would follow these four phases: 
+Phase I: Introducing different platforms for embedded hardware and how to program them.
+Phase II: Introducing Machine Learning with its types and some famous examples 
+Phase III: Building Embedded Learning Systems
+Phase IV: Advanced issues towards a reliable, power efficient and real
